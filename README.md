# gammapy_SyLC

An add-on toolbox for [gammapy](https://github.com/gammapy) to add functionalities for the simulation of synthetic lightcurves with the [Emmanoulopoulos algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.0304), an envelope framework for the periodogram of a lightcurve and a fitting procedure for the PSD.

## Usage

In your gammapy-dev environment you can install gammapy_SyLC by running:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/cgalelli/gammapy_SyLC.git
cd gammapy_SyLC
python -m pip install -e .
~~~

You will need a gammapy-dev version for the functions to work. From gammapy-1.3 onwards, normal versions will work as well.
